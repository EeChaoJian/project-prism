# Project Prism

**AI Boardroom for SME financial decisions.**

Accounting software records history. Project Prism lets owners rehearse
decisions before making them: two AI executives argue the trade-off, then a
deterministic simulation shows what the owner's choice does to cash, runway,
and payroll risk.

**The math is deterministic. The debate is AI. The decision is yours.**

> Built for the AMD Developer Hackathon ACT II — Track 3 (Unicorn Track).
> Boardroom inference runs on [Fireworks AI](https://fireworks.ai)
> using the configured Fireworks model.

## Architecture — deterministic core, AI on top

The most important design decision: **the AI never calculates a number.** Every
figure comes from plain, testable TypeScript. The board only *explains* the
trade-offs. If the AI is unavailable, the app falls back to a static board and
the numbers are identical — the demo cannot break.

```
                 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                 │            checkFinancialHealth()            │  ← deterministic

            ┌───────────────────┐          ┌────────────────────────┐
            │  AI boardroom      │          │  simulateDecision()    │  ← deterministic
            │  (Fireworks AI)    │          │  each option's outcome │
            │  explains only     │          │  cash / runway / risk  │
            │  ⤷ static fallback │          └───────────┬────────────┘
            └───────────────────┘                      │
                      │                                 ▼
                      └──────────▶  UI: compare options, pick, see impact
```

**Why this matters for judges:** the AI is *enhancement, not dependency*. Pull
the API key and the product still works, still shows correct numbers, still
tells the story. That is the opposite of most "AI" demos.

## The problem

Small businesses often do not fail because revenue disappears. They fail
because owners see the cash crunch too late and choose without understanding
the effect on payroll, runway, and overdue invoices.

## The demo

```
Payroll alert
    ↓
AI boardroom
    ↓
Owner decision
    ↓
Simulation engine
    ↓
Updated cash position
```

The demo opens on an **emergency briefing** — a crisis snapshot (cash, payroll
countdown, projected shortfall, runway, risk level) with one CTA: *Enter
Boardroom*. Inside, two named executives weigh in: **Maya Chen (CFO)** argues
for preserving cash; **Daniel Reyes (Collections Manager)** disagrees and pushes
receivables recovery. A **Compare all options** table shows every action's
payroll outcome, cash, and runway with the best one badged *Recommended*. The
owner chooses, and the simulation updates the numbers — and the risk level —
instantly.

Payroll is today's scenario. The platform pattern can extend to pricing,
hiring, expansion, funding, and other high-stakes SME decisions.

## Why AI

The AI does not calculate the outcome. It explains the trade-off.

Why AI? Because different stakeholders optimize different objectives, and AI
lets them reason from those perspectives while the deterministic engine
guarantees consistent outcomes.

The deterministic engine owns the math:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Financial inputs"] --> B["Deterministic simulation"]
    B --> C["Updated metrics"]
    D["AI boardroom reasoning"] --> C
    C --> E["Owner decision"]
```

That split is the product's credibility: useful boardroom reasoning without
letting the model invent financial numbers.

## How a session runs

```
Risk detected → agents respond → owner chooses → simulation updates
```

1. A sample company (**Harbour Coffee Roasters**) is loaded — or the owner
   enters their own numbers.
2. `checkFinancialHealth()` detects a payroll cash crunch.
3. The boardroom convenes: two AI executives (**CFO**, then **Collections
   Manager**) reason **sequentially** over the same numbers — the second
   reads the first's argument and pushes back.
4. The owner clicks a decision.
5. `simulateDecision()` deterministically updates the metrics and chart.

---

## The AI boardroom

Clicking **Convene the Boardroom** streams a live, two-step analysis:

- **Step 1 — CFO** evaluates the deterministic financial numbers and returns a
  headline, recommendation, three bullets, primary risk, and payroll coverage score.
- **Step 2 — Collections Manager** receives the CFO's *literal* output, reads
  its stance, and responds from the receivables angle.

Both inferences run **server-side** in `/api/boardroom` via
[Fireworks AI](https://fireworks.ai) (`accounts/fireworks/models/minimax-m3`
by default). The route
streams NDJSON events so the UI shows a live "Step 1 → Step 2" indicator.

**The AI never invents numbers.** Every figure comes from the deterministic
engine; the agents only produce natural-language reasoning. Their JSON is
schema-validated server-side.

**Payroll coverage score is deterministic.** The displayed score reflects
whether that agent's recommended response protects payroll in the simulation.

**No key? It still works.** If `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` is missing, the API errors,
or a response fails to decode, the route automatically falls back to the static
mock boardroom in `lib/agents.ts`. A badge under the cards shows whether the
result came from **Fireworks AI** or the **offline fallback**.

## Tech stack

- [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router, streaming route handler)
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) for the cash projection chart
- [Fireworks AI](https://fireworks.ai) for the boardroom agents

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The app runs **with no setup** — the boardroom uses the offline
fallback. To enable live AI, add a Fireworks key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# then edit .env.local and set FIREWORKS_API_KEY=fw_...
```

Restart `npm run dev` after changing env vars.

## The financial logic

`checkFinancialHealth(state)` computes:

| Value                        | Formula                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Expected collections         | `sum(invoice.amount × collectionProbability)`                   |
| Operating burn to payroll    | `monthlyOpex ÷ 30 × payrollDueInDays`                           |
| Projected cash before payroll| `cashBalance + expectedCollections − operatingBurnToPayroll − equipmentPurchase` |
| Payroll gap                  | `payrollAmount − projectedCashBeforePayroll`                    |
| Payroll risk                 | `payrollGap > 0`                                                |
| Runway days                  | `cashBalance ÷ (monthlyOpex ÷ 30)`                             |

> Projected cash before payroll nets out `operatingBurnToPayroll` — the
> operating cash the business burns over the days until payroll — so the
> deterministic engine reflects the real cash crunch ahead of payday.

`simulateDecision(state, action)` supports four actions — *Prioritize Client
Alpha*, *Delay Equipment Purchase*, *Offer Early Payment Discount*, and *Do
Nothing* — and returns the updated state plus before/after health snapshots.

## Testing the boardroom locally

**Offline / fallback (no key needed):**

1. `npm run dev`, open http://localhost:3000.
2. Click **Convene the Boardroom**. Watch the Step 1 → Step 2 indicator, then
   two cards appear with a **"Offline fallback"** badge.

You can also hit the API directly:

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/boardroom \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

You'll see the streamed NDJSON events (`step`, `agent`, `agent`, `done`) with
`"source":"fallback"`.

**Live AI (with a Fireworks key):**

1. `cp .env.example .env.local` and set `FIREWORKS_API_KEY=fw_...`.
2. Restart `npm run dev`, click **Convene the Boardroom**.
3. The badge now reads **"Generated live by Fireworks AI"**, and the second
   agent's reasoning explicitly references the CFO's stance.

If the key is invalid or the API is unreachable, the run still completes using
the fallback — the demo never breaks.

## What's next (not in this milestone)

- Parallel / multi-round agent debate beyond the two-step sequence
- Streaming token-level output into the cards
- The deterministic engine stays the source of truth for all numbers
